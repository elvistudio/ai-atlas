# Public L1/L2 Stable ID Storage Design

Status: draft policy / under review / not canonical

Source issue: [#22 — Formalize canonical taxonomy JSON](https://github.com/elvistudio/ai-atlas/issues/22)

Related issues:

- [#15 — Define stable ID convention for taxonomy nodes](https://github.com/elvistudio/ai-atlas/issues/15)
- [#16 — Define relation target typing for structured taxonomy nodes](https://github.com/elvistudio/ai-atlas/issues/16)
- [#18 — Normalize structured draft schema for Level 3 nodes](https://github.com/elvistudio/ai-atlas/issues/18)

## Purpose

Define where stable IDs for public canonical Level 1 and Level 2 concepts should live before broad typed-relation migration or Level 3 promotion.

This draft does not assign IDs, modify canonical taxonomy files, update generated views, or authorize Level 3 promotion.

## Problem

The Surface Realization private pilot showed that relation targets need stable IDs for graph-readiness, but public canonical L1/L2 concepts currently have canonical names without approved stable IDs.

The project therefore needs a storage decision before it can safely:

- assign stable IDs to public L1/L2 concepts;
- migrate private relation targets to typed relation objects;
- validate canonical relation targets;
- build a reliable relations graph;
- promote any Level 3 draft to canonical status.

## Requirements

The chosen storage model should:

- preserve the canonical taxonomy tree as the source of truth;
- keep IDs stable when hierarchy placement, hierarchy depth, or concept type changes;
- avoid mixing concept identity with parent placement;
- be easy to validate automatically;
- support readable diffs and expert review;
- support generated Markdown, Markmap, Mermaid, Obsidian, and future website/search views;
- support aliases, former names, provisional private IDs, deprecation, and successor mappings;
- avoid broad repository churn during the first ID assignment.

## Options considered

### Option A — Store stable IDs directly in `taxonomy/ai-taxonomy-l1-l2.json`

Add stable ID and identity metadata directly to each canonical L1/L2 node.

Possible fields:

```json
{
  "id": "ai:natural-language-processing",
  "name": "Natural Language Processing",
  "aliases": [],
  "former_ids": [],
  "provisional_ids": []
}
```

Advantages:

- canonical identity travels with the canonical node;
- easiest for validators and generated views;
- fewer files to synchronize;
- relation targets can resolve directly against canonical JSON;
- simplest long-term model for public machine-readable taxonomy.

Disadvantages:

- modifies the canonical taxonomy JSON;
- creates a large first assignment diff;
- requires careful review to avoid accidental taxonomy meaning changes;
- future identity metadata could make the canonical file heavier.

### Option B — Store stable IDs in a sidecar registry

Create a separate file, for example:

```text
taxonomy/stable-ids.json
```

The registry maps canonical names or paths to stable IDs and identity metadata.

Possible shape:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "ai:natural-language-processing",
      "canonical_name": "Natural Language Processing",
      "canonical_path": [
        "Natural Language and Speech",
        "Natural Language Processing"
      ],
      "aliases": [],
      "former_ids": [],
      "provisional_ids": []
    }
  ]
}
```

Advantages:

- avoids immediate edits to canonical taxonomy JSON;
- keeps identity metadata isolated and reviewable;
- can be introduced as an experimental bridge;
- can map private provisional IDs without changing taxonomy data.

Disadvantages:

- creates a second source that must be synchronized;
- validators must check cross-file consistency;
- canonical names and paths can drift from the registry;
- generated views must merge data from multiple files;
- harder for contributors to know where the canonical identity lives.

### Option C — Generate stable IDs as metadata only

Do not store stable IDs manually. Generate them from canonical names and paths during build or validation.

Advantages:

- no immediate canonical JSON changes;
- low maintenance if names never change;
- easy to prototype.

Disadvantages:

- generated IDs are not truly stable across renames;
- deprecation and successor mappings become difficult;
- aliases and provisional private IDs have no authoritative home;
- relation targets cannot safely reference generated IDs unless generation rules become canonical;
- weak fit for long-term graph and API use.

## Recommended draft direction

Use **Option A: store stable IDs directly in `taxonomy/ai-taxonomy-l1-l2.json`**, but only after a separate explicit ID-assignment PR.

Reasoning:

- AI Atlas treats canonical taxonomy files as the source of truth.
- Stable identity is core taxonomy metadata, not merely generated output.
- Relation target validation should resolve against canonical taxonomy data directly.
- Generated views, graph exports, and future search should not need to infer or merge identity from an unstable sidecar.
- Sidecar registries are useful for transition planning, but they should not become the long-term source of canonical identity.

## Transitional model

Before modifying canonical JSON, a temporary review artifact may be used to plan assignments.

Recommended temporary file, if needed:

```text
taxonomy/policies/public-l1-l2-stable-id-assignment-draft.md
```

This file may list proposed IDs for review, but it must remain a policy draft and not a source of canonical IDs.

Avoid creating a long-lived `taxonomy/stable-ids.json` unless reviewers explicitly choose the sidecar model.

## First assignment PR rules

A future L1/L2 stable ID assignment PR should:

- modify only `taxonomy/ai-taxonomy-l1-l2.json` and any directly derived views if explicitly authorized;
- add IDs without changing canonical names, hierarchy, ordering, concept type, or taxonomy meaning;
- include a machine validation check for ID uniqueness;
- include a review note mapping known private provisional IDs to proposed canonical IDs;
- not migrate private Level 3 JSON relations in the same PR;
- not promote any Level 3 draft;
- not close #15 or #16 automatically.

## Proposed minimal canonical fields

For L1/L2 nodes, start with the smallest stable identity surface:

```json
{
  "id": "ai:natural-language-processing",
  "name": "Natural Language Processing"
}
```

Additional identity metadata should be added only when needed:

```json
{
  "aliases": [],
  "former_ids": [],
  "provisional_ids": []
}
```

Do not add empty metadata arrays everywhere unless validators or generated views require uniform fields.

## Validator implications

After public L1/L2 IDs are assigned, validators should eventually:

- require unique IDs across canonical taxonomy nodes;
- reject duplicate IDs;
- reject malformed IDs;
- verify that typed relation targets with `target_status: "canonical"` resolve to canonical IDs;
- warn on `canonical_pending_id` targets that can now be upgraded to `canonical`;
- verify that Markdown and generated views remain synchronized with canonical JSON.

## Impact on current issues

### #22

This issue should decide the storage model. The recommended direction is direct storage in canonical JSON after explicit review.

### #15

Stable ID convention can proceed using `ai:<slug>` as the preferred draft format, but actual IDs should not be considered approved until the L1/L2 assignment PR is reviewed.

### #16

`canonical_pending_id` remains valid until public canonical IDs are assigned. After assignment, relation targets should migrate toward `target_status: "canonical"` with `target_id`.

### #18

Structured draft schema can continue using provisional private IDs until public IDs and relation target rules are stable enough for migration.

## Open questions

- Should empty `aliases`, `former_ids`, or `provisional_ids` fields be required on every canonical node, or only when non-empty?
- Should canonical Markdown views display IDs, hide them, or include them in comments/metadata blocks?
- Should generated Markmap, Mermaid, and Obsidian outputs include stable IDs?
- Should private provisional ID mappings live in canonical JSON, a migration note, or private review files?
- Should the first ID assignment PR cover all public L1/L2 nodes or only the L1/L2 nodes referenced by current private pilots?

## Current recommendation

Proceed in this order:

1. Review and approve or revise this storage recommendation.
2. Prepare a separate L1/L2 stable ID assignment PR.
3. Update #15 and #16 based on the accepted storage model.
4. Update the private Surface Realization pilot to use the accepted relation target status pattern.
5. Continue private structured schema normalization only after the ID and relation-target path is coherent.
